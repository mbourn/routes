routes

This program creates a binary search tree of basic nodes.  Each
contains three pointers (left, right, and parent), a string (city 
name), and an int (the distance to the parent city).  The user 
can add cities, search for cities, find the direct path between 
two cities, and find the distance between two cities.  I think I 
may have been a little sleep deprived when I wrote the comments.
